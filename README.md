Title of the Project:-  “Discover Chhattisgarh: Ek Virtual Safar”


Introduction / Background
Chhattisgarh is a state with rich culture, heritage, and natural beauty. Many people are not aware of its famous temples, waterfalls, museums, and historical monuments. With the growth of technology, especially Virtual Reality (VR), we can provide users with an immersive experience of exploring these places from home. This project combines tourism and VR to promote Chhattisgarh’s heritage in a modern and interactive way. (Also provide trip plans and history details about all places).
